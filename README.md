# ForwardJS Raffle

### Description

The ForwardJS Raffle is a Node.js-based application designed to randomly select a winner from a list of participants. It uses a text file containing participant names and provides a fun, animated selection process to determine the winner.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd forwardjs-raffle
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare a text file (e.g., `names.txt`) with one participant name per line.
2. Run the raffle script with the file path as an argument:
   ```bash
   node raffle.js names.txt [number-of-winners]
   ```
   - The `number-of-winners` parameter is optional and defaults to 1
   - Example for multiple winners: `node raffle.js names.txt 3`
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the raffle and see the winner(s).

### Example

#### Input (`names.txt`):

```
Alice
Bob
Charlie
Diana
```

#### Output:

For a single winner:
```
ðŸŽ‰ WINNER ðŸŽ‰

Congratulations to the winner of the JetBrains subscription!
```

For multiple winners (e.g., 3 winners):
```
ðŸŽ‰ WINNERS (3) ðŸŽ‰
